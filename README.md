# Pseudo_Cell_Automata - JHU 625.740 Final Project

## Snippet from Paper Introduction:

One technique that is not commonly used for data clas-sification is cellular automation.  Cellular automation simulations could be used to “grow” classification re-gions, which could prove helpful when data can only be separated into categories using complicated, nonlinear boundaries.  A simple form of using cellular automa-tion as a data mining tool was introduced in a paper by Fawcett [3] in which local decisions are shown to viably define overall classification for specific two-dimensional datasets.  However, the design of this cel-lular automation is kept simple, which can lead to inac-curacies when there is not a very clear separation be-tween datapoints that belong to different classes.

In this paper, a pseudo-cellular automation approach for classifying data is purposed which seeks to bridge the gap between classifier accuracy, practical imple-mentation and complexity of theory.
